This project provides easy-to-parse data about emoji, along with a spritesheet-style 
images for use on the web.

You can see a catalog of the emoji data here: http://unicodey.com/emoji-data/table.htm


## Installation

The git repo is pretty big (almost 4GB), but contains everything. If you want to use `npm`, you can:

    npm install emoji-datasource

This will only install the 32px full-fidelity spritesheets. If you want different size sheets (16,20 or 64px),
quantized sheets (128 or 256 color) or the individual images (at 64px) then you'll need to install additional
npm modules:

    npm install emoji-datasource-apple
    npm install emoji-datasource-google
    npm install emoji-datasource-twitter
    npm install emoji-datasource-emojione
    npm install emoji-datasource-facebook
    npm install emoji-datasource-messenger


## Using the data

The file you want is `emoji.json`. It contains an array of entries for emoji that 
look like this:

	[
		{
			"name": "WHITE UP POINTING INDEX",
			"unified": "261D-FE0F",
			"non_qualified": "261D",
			"docomo": null,
			"au": "E4F6",
			"softbank": "E00F",
			"google": "FEB98",
			"image": "261d.png",
			"sheet_x": 1,
			"sheet_y": 2,
			"short_name": "point_up",
			"short_names": [
				"point_up"
			],
			"text": null,
			"texts": null,
			"category": "People",
			"sort_order": 116,
			"added_in": "1.4",
			"has_img_apple": true,
			"has_img_google": true,
			"has_img_twitter": true,
			"has_img_emojione": false,
			"has_img_facebook": false,
			"has_img_messenger": false,
			"skin_variations": {
				"1F3FB": {
					"unified": "261D-1F3FB",
					"image": "261d-1f3fb.png",
					"sheet_x": 1,
					"sheet_y": 3,
					"added_in": "6.0",
					"has_img_apple": true,
					"has_img_google": false,
					"has_img_twitter": false,
					"has_img_emojione": false
					"has_img_facebook": false
					"has_img_messenger": false
				},
				...
			},
			"obsoletes": "ABCD-1234",
			"obsoleted_by": "5678-90EF"
		},
		...
	]

An explanation of the various fields is in order:

* `name` - The offical Unicode name, in SHOUTY UPPERCASE.
* `unified` - The Unicode codepoint, as 4-5 hex digits. Where an emoji
   needs 2 or more codepoints, they are specified like `1F1EA-1F1F8`.
   For emoji that need to specifiy a variation selector (`-FE0F`), that
   is included here.
* `non_qualified` - For emoji that also have usage without a variation
   selector, that version is included here (otherwise is `null`).
* `docomo`, `au`, `softbank`, `google` - The legacy Unicode codepoints used
   by various mobile vendors.
* `image` - The name of the image file.
* `sheet_x` & `sheet_y` - The position of the image in the spritesheets.
* `short_name` - The commonly-agreed upon short name for the image, as
   supported in campfire, github etc via the :colon-syntax:
* `short_names` - An array of all the known short names.
* `text` - An ASCII version of the emoji (e.g. `:)`), or null where
   none exists.
* `texts` - An array of ASCII emoji that should convert into this emoji.
   Each ASCII emoji will only appear against a single emoji entry.
* `has_img_*` - A flag for whether the given image set has an image (named by the `image` prop) available.
* `added_id` - Unicode versions in which this codepoint/sequence was added.
* `skin_variations` - For skin-varying emoji, a list of alternative glyphs, keyed by the skin tone.
* `obsoletes` / `obsoleted_by` - Emoji that are no longer used, in preference of gendered versions.
